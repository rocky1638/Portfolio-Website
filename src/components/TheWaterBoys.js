              <p className="blog-text">
                For as long as I can remember, I have always been fond of music,
                and singing. In fact, I've had many slightly embarassing moments
                related to my singing, including a time in which I sang to
                myself in the middle of a test{' '}
                <i>(I somehow did not realize I was singing at the time)</i>.
                <br />
                <br />
                With this in mind, it should come as no surprise that entering
                the University of Waterloo as a first year student, I had heard
                of The Water Boys, and had seen many of their performances on
                YouTube. However, I would have never expected myself to audition
                for them, much less go to the semi-finals of an{' '}
                <b>
                  <i>international a capella competition</i>

                with them.
                <br />
                <br />
                In my first term at school, a couple of friends of mine
                convinced me to join a capella club, and I ended up spending my
                term with ACE, the non-auditioned group. As the first term flew
                by, I found myself looking forward to the rehearsals, and by the
                end of the term, realized that I would miss the singing, the
                dancing, and most of all, the people.
                <br />
                <br />
                It was then that I decided that I would audition for the Water
                Boys the following term...

              <h2 className="blog-2 bold">The Audition</h2>
              <p className="blog-text">
                To say that I was nervous for my audition would be the{' '}
                <i>understatement of the century</i>. After nervously warming up
                in the neighboring room for a couple minutes, I was called in,
                and my audition began with a range check.
                <br />
                <br />
                The range check went surprisingly well, considering that I
                didn't know what to expect. I managed to sing a{' '}

                as my lowest note. <b>Pretty good!</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Next, it was time to sing my songs. For my solo pieces, I
                decided to sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk9K032K7UM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking To The Moon</a>, by Bruno Mars, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvgZkm1xWPE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viva La
                Vida</a>, by Coldplay. I felt like they both went pretty well, and I went away feeling pretty good about my chances of getting called back.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Lo and behold, that night, I got an email inviting me to callbacks the next day. Callbacks were essentially run like what a normal rehearsal would be, and long story short, I eventually got the email congratulating me on making it into the Water Boys!

              <h2 className="blog-2 bold">ICCA Quarterfinals @ UWaterloo</h2>
              <p className="blog-text">
                The first real performance that we had in the term was the ICCA Quarterfinals. Conveniently, they were actually held at the University of Waterloo this time, so there was no need to travel anywhere. Five out of the ten groups competing at the quarterfinal were actually from Waterloo - the rest included teams from Toronto and Queens.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The day started with light practice in the morning, a break, and then soundcheck. As 7pm rolled around, it was time for the show to start. We watched the groups perfom, and waited for our turn. All the groups were really good, and to be completely honest, I did not expect to place in the top 2, which would have allowed us to go the semifinals in Buffalo, NY later that term. However, at the end of the night, all the groups got onto the stage, and to my dismay, <b>we placed second!</b>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Here's a picture from that night, after we got the news.

                There wasn't too much time to celebrate though, as our next competition was at Queen's university in London <i>(Ontario)</i>, and although we were still high off of our win at quarterfinals, we wanted to use this competition as an opportunity to really work on putting emotion into our performance. 
              </p>
              <h2 className="blog-2 bold">Queen's Acapella Competition</h2>
              <p className="blog-text">
                The drive to London took around 3 hours, though it felt much shorter as time seems to fly when you're in a car full of people <i>who can sing</i> jamming out to songs on the radio.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The venue was great, with audience seated on <i>all</i> sides of the stage, meaning that we had to keep up our emotion and faces all the time. After warmup, soundcheck,and watching the other groups, our time finally came to perform. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                All in all, most of us felt like we performed very well, and it ended up showing in the standings. We placed third, behind a fellow Waterloo group (In Full Colour). All in all, it was a really great experience.

                With the past two performances under our belt, we felt more and more ready to crush our ICCA Semifinals performance.

              <h2 className="blog-2 bold">ICCA Semifinals @ UBuffalo</h2>
              <p className="blog-text">
                This was it. Place first here, and we would automatically be given the opportunity to compete against the other top nine collegiate a capella groups in the world, at Beacon Theatre in New York City. After driving to Buffalo, the day started out just like any other performance day, besides the fact that we were in the <i>United States</i>.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                We went through warmups, sound check, and eventually, the time for performing came. We were somewhere in the middle when it came to performance order, and after watching the previous groups perform, it was pretty clear to me that the quality of the groups here far surpassed the average quality at the quarterfinals. Either way, we performed, and I am sure that each and every one of us left our hearts and voices out there on the stage, delivering possibly our best performance yet.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Sadly, we didn't end up placing in the top three. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCukDPShUdmiaQaHDGFMAbuA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Potsdam Pitches</a> ended up placing first, with our very own In Full Colour placing in second. Regardless of the outcome however, we all had an absolutely amazing time being able to compete with and against such talented singers. Here's some photos from that night:

                I cannot imagine how different my term would have been if I had not been given the opportunity to be a part of this amazing group of people. I will not forget the experiences we shared and the goals we worked for together for a very long time. Thank you Lumibao, Paknys, Wes, Hayes, Nick R, Nick H, Angelo, Jake, Alex, Zack, DGuo, Rav, Ryan, and Yamen for making my term a memorable one.
